    <h1>VALIDATED BUT STILL UNPAID: GES Recruits Demand Immediate Release of Regional Letters, Staff IDs and Salaries</h1>

    <p><span style="color: #444444; float: left; font-size: 38px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; padding-right: 8px;">N</span>ewly recruited staff of the Ghana Education Service (GES) are calling on the Government and the GES to urgently complete all outstanding administrative processes — including the release of regional posting letters, Staff Identification Numbers (Staff IDs), and salary payments — following the successful validation of their recruitment status.</p>  

    <p>In a letter dated 5th March 2025, the GES directed all Regional Directors of Education to lead a validation exercise for affected staff who were recruited before 7th December 2024 but had not yet been placed on the payroll. The directive, signed by Ag. Director-General Prof. Ernest Kofi Davis, outlined a process involving regional HR officers, internal auditors, and accountants to verify documents and clear validated staff for reinstatement.</p>  

    <p>The recruits say they have fully complied, submitting their appointment letters, academic credentials, licensure, and national service certificates as required. The validation — which forms the basis for reinstatement — was concluded by 14th March 2025.</p>  

    <p>Now, with the validation process completed, the recruits are urging GES Headquarters to act swiftly to finalize postings, issue Staff IDs, and process salary payments without further delay.</p>  

    <p>Some recruits remain unable to report to post due to delays in issuing regional posting letters, which confirm their appointments and authorize schools to accept them. Others who are already at post continue to serve without Staff IDs or pay, despite having met every requirement.</p>  

    <blockquote>“We have fulfilled all obligations — now we ask the Government and GES to fulfill theirs,” a recruit emphasized.</blockquote>  

    <p>The affected recruits reaffirm their commitment to serve the nation and are calling on the Government and GES to honour its own directive by completing the process their validation has made possible.</p>
